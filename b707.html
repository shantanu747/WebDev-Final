					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div id="panAm707"></div>
					<p>Although the 707 was not the first passenger jet airliner, it was the most popular and successful jet aircraft which helped usher in the jet age. Introduced in 1958, the 707 allowed passengers to fly thousands of miles at speeds previously unachievable for passenger air travel. Jet engines made air travel cheaper, more reliable, and faster. What was previously a mode of transport for the privileged few, was quickly becoming the way for the majority to travel.</p>

				<!-- Design and Dev -->
				<div class="infoCard">
					<h2>Making a New Kind of Plane</h2>
					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<div id="Dash80"></div>
					<p>The 707 was originally conceived as the 367-80, called the “Dash 80”. The design was geared more for the military, who needed new tanker jets in the Cold War era. The first flight of the prototype was in July 1954. It became clear to Boeing the Dash 80 had great potential as a passenger carrier as well. To compete with other passenger airliners in service, the fuselage width was increased to allow for 6-abreast seating. The original Dash 80 concept was ordered by the US Air Force as the KC-135 Stratotanker.</p>

					<h3>707-120</h3>
					<div id="Prod707"></div>
					<p>The first production 707 was the 707-120B model. It was powered by the Pratt and Whitney JT3D engine, a derivative of the J57 engine that powered the B-52 Bomber. This is when the “Dash 80” became the “707”. It featured a larger wing, wider cabin, and a higher maximum takeoff weight allowing for more passengers and fuel. This set the passenger capacity of the 707 up to 189 maximum and giving it a range of 4,000 miles.</p>

					<h2>A New Way to Travel</h2>
					<div id="FF707"></div>
					<p>The 707-120 took off for the first on December 20, 1957 with the FAA awarding it certification almost a year later on September 18, 1958. The British Aviation Authorities demanded an improvement to go-around performance with one engine inoperable, leading to delays before it was certified in Europe. Boeing increased the height of the tail and added a support fin to meet these demands.</p>

					<p>Pan Am was the first airline to take delivery of the new 707. The first 707 was christened by President Eisenhower on October 17, 1958. The plane flew its first commercial flight between New York and Paris on October 26, 1958 followed by domestic service with Pan Am, Continental, National Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Eastern Airlines.</p>

					<div id="EIS707"></div>
					<p>The 707 quickly became the most popular jetliner in the world at the time. In fact, the plane catalyzed rapid investment and developments in airport terminals, runways, airline catering, baggage handling, reservation systems, and other airport infrastructure. The airplane could efficiently carry passengers large distances with fewer fuel stops and a shorter flight time. This reduced barrier to travel, along with decreasing costs, encouraged many to fly or even travel for the first time in their lives. In a short period of time, the 707 proved too incapable of keeping up with the trend it had started. </p>

					<h2>Further Developments</h2>
					<h3>707-320</h3>
					<div id="B7073"></div>
					<p>The 707-320 was a longer, more powerful derivative of the original 707. The fuselage was extended by roughly 7 feet, which allowed for more passengers and payload. The wigs were also extended to allow for a heavier takeoff weight and to store more fuel. Fuel capacity was improved, increasing the range by 1,600 miles allowing the aircraft to cross oceans nonstop. The first flight of this type was on January 11, 1958 with certification and first passenger service taking place in August 1959. A total of 69 of the type were delivered.</p>

					<p>A couple of specialized variants were also produced by Boeing. The 707-420 was a -320 with a different engine option that was ordered by Lufthansa. The 707-138 was a specialized 707-120 built exclusively for Qantas. It was shorter than the standard 707-120 but with the same MTOW and fuel capacity, giving it a greater range, which Qantas needed. The 707-220 was a 707-120 with more powerful engines giving it better short runway performance which was designed for Braniff International. </p>

					<h2>Significance</h2>
					<div id="Why707"></div>
					<p>By the end of the 707’s production run 1979, a total of 1,010 planes were built and delivered. While certainly an impressive achievement in terms of production numbers, the 707’s biggest achievement was the lasting influence the plane had on air travel. Once the people had experienced how quick, easy, and comfortable air travel could be, there was no turning back. Almost unanimously, it is agreed that the Boeing 707 initiated the Jet Age, and set the baseline for air travel which has been iteratively improved through the years into what it is today. </p>
