					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div id="JumboIntro"></div>
					<p>The Boeing 747, affectionately called the “Queen of the Skies”, was the largest passenger airliner for 37 consecutive years. Introduced in 1969, the Boeing 747 program was intended to be a stop-gap solution until a supersonic passenger airliner was introduced in the near future. As such, the 747 wasn’t supposed to sell more than 400 units. However, the supersonic airliner dream never materialized and the 747 proved so successful as a passenger and freighter, Boeing assembled the 1,000th in 1993 and the program eventually surpassed 1,500 units in June 2014.</p>

					<p>The 747 was the backbone of the long-haul fleets around the world throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The airliner’s iconic design and unparalleled ability to comfortably fly a large number of passengers over long distances had made the 747 the most recognized aircraft in the world. Its unrivaled passenger capacity and its range meant that the 747 was often the only choice to reliably carry passengers and cargo long distances. Even if one hasn’t flown on the 747, one has certainly seen the planes before. It has been the aircraft of choice to carry many of the world’s leaders, including Air Force One, which carries the President of the United States. </p>

					<h2>Design and Development</h2>
					<div id="Dev747"></div>
					<p>The Boeing 707 was successful in making flying faster, cheaper, and more accessible to the masses. This led to a spike in demand for air travel that outpaced airport expansion. Boeing’s most important customer, Pan Am, approached Boeing for an airplane twice the size of the 707. Hence, the widebody was born. The cabin of the 747 would be the equivalent of two 707s side-by-side.</p>

					<p>Since it was expected that the 747 would be an interim passenger carrier until the supersonic jet was produced, the designers thought ahead and planned a life for the program after its passenger carrying days. The large plane would be ideal for flying cargo. Since loading cargo from the front was preferred, the cockpit was placed above the main deck leading to the birth of the iconic “bulge” at the time. Initially, this bulge was used solely to house the cockpit and as a lounge with no assigned seats for First Class passengers.</p>

					<div id="Eng747"></div>
					<p>Such a substantial increase in size meant substantial reengineering of the engines, landing gears, wings, and the production facility itself. Existing engines could neither provide sufficient power nor the fuel economy demanded of the new airplane. Pratt and Whitney developed all-new high-bypass turbofan engines that delivered twice the power while consuming a third less fuel. It was a revolution in engine technology.</p>

					<p>The wings and control surfaces also had to redesigned to handle the forces and pressures of a larger and heavier aircraft. Boeing had to come up with new designs for the slats and flaps. This allowed the new plane to land and takeoff from existing airports despite its size and weight. To address safety concerns, multiple redundancies were built into the controlling and engine systems of the aircraft. Should one of the systems fail, there were backups that would ensure the aircraft landed safely.</p>

					<div id="everett"></div>
					<p>There was another problem Boeing had to confront during the development phase – a location to build the new plane. The company did not have a facility large enough to assemble a 747 in. A new assembly plant was being built in Everett, Washington in parallel with the 747 program. Parts of the facility were still under construction while the first prototype of the 747 was in final assembly. The Everett plant is the largest building by volume ever built and has been expanded as Boeing introduced more models. </p>

					<h2>The Beast Takes Off</h2>

					<h3>First Flight</h3>
					<p>The first 747 was rolled out of the Everett factory on September 30, 1968 before a large crowd. Many ground tests were performed before the plane was allowed to take off to ensure all the systems worked as intended. On February 9, 1969 the aircraft had its first flight, the airplane handled well despite its size.</p>

					<div id="jumboFlight"></div>
					<h3>Testing and Certification</h3>
					<p>The testing phase was not without its problems however. The new high-bypass turbofan engines ran into issues with stalling or engine seizures. These engine issues delayed deliveries by several months while Pratt and Whitney figured out a fix. The wings also suffered from excessive vibrations, called “flutter”, under certain flying conditions. Parts of the wings were modified to fix this problem. The FAA finally issued an airworthiness certificate for the 747 in December 1969, clearing it for airlines deliveries and passenger flights.</p>

					<h3>Entry Into Service</h3>
					<div id="JumboEIS"></div>
					<p>The 747 had its first passenger flight with Pan Am on January 22, 1970 from New York to London. The flight was scheduled for the previous day but engine issues delayed the flight until the following day. The entry to service of the aircraft was smooth with only minor technical issues popping up that were quickly fixed.</p>

					<p>However, the economic crisis and oil shortage of the 1970s affected 747 operations greatly. When fully loaded, the 747 was very cost efficient and economical to operate. However, a moderately loaded 747 used roughly the same amount of fuel and had the same operating cost, reducing margins for operators and suddenly making the airplane very expensive to continue operating. Some airlines who operated the plane simply for its range or for its prestige switched to operating smaller tri-jets rather than 747s. The 747 needed to change with the times.</p>

					<h2>Further Developments</h2>

					<h3>747SP</h3>
					<div id="B747SP"></div>
					<p>The 747SP was a much shorter version of the standard 747. It was a special request from Pan Am and Iran Air. It carried more fuel but the reduced weight of the smaller frame and less passengers meant the 747SP could fly very long distances nonstop. The 747SP made routes such as Tehran to New York, which at the time was the longest nonstop flight in the world, possible. The airplane also had improved short runway performance, making it an attractive option for airlines trying to fly to major airports with small runways. A total of 45 were built with one frame being used by NASA for its SOFIA experiment.</p>

					<h3>747-200</h3>
					<div id="B742"></div>
					<p>There was demand for a 747 with improved range and payload capability. Boeing responded by producing the 747-200, which featured much more powerful engines, increased max takeoff weight (MTOW), added fuel capacity, and a stretched upper deck which could seat more revenue passengers. The aircraft entered service in February 1971 and 393 of the model were built in total. It was also the first 747 to offer multiple engine options as well as a combi version, which was half passenger and half cargo aircraft. This allowed the airlines more flexibility which made the new 747 more economical to operate consistently.</p>

					<h3>747-300</h3>
					<div id="B743"></div>
					<p>The 747-300 featured the biggest visual difference to the 747 series yet. The upper deck was stretched by over 23 feet, allowing for more passengers to be seated in the upper deck. The cabin and staircase layout were also modified to allow for more passenger seating on the lower deck. The rest of the aircraft was the identical to the 747-200 – same engines, fuel capacity, and MTOW. This resulted in a slight decrease in range but the increased passenger capacity meant the airline’s cost per passenger was reduced which helped make operating the 747-300 more economical. The first 747-300 was delivered in March 1983 and a total of 81 were built.</p>

					<h3>747-400</h3>
					<div id="B744"></div>
					<p>The 747-400 was the biggest upgrade to the 747 series. It retained the stretched upper deck of the 747-300 but featured a new generation of high-bypass turbofan engines which delivered much more power with greatly reduced fuel consumption. It was also the first 747 to feature a glass cockpit; all of the analog dials and switches were reduced from 971 to 365 with all of them being replaced with electronic screens and buttons. This eliminated the need for a flight engineer, reducing cockpit crew from 3 to 2. Another visual difference between previous versions was the addition of a winglet, which decreased fuel consumption by another 4% and helped increase cruise speed further. The 747-400 was the longest range 747 yet, with over 8,000 miles of range. This made the -400 the most popular 747 model ever with a total of 694 built.</p>

					<h3></h3>
					<div id="B748"></div>
					<p>The latest variant of the 747 series, the 747-8, was built in response to the Airbus A380, the largest passenger aircraft in the world. For the first time since its introduction, the body of the 747 was stretched to 250 feet, making it the longest passenger aircraft in the world. It also featured a redesigned wing, with improvements in aerodynamic technology being used in the 787 applied to the 747-8 wing. The airplane was powered by an upgraded version of the massively more fuel efficient 787 engines. Last but not least, the 747-8 is controlled by a new state of the art fly-by-wire avionics system. The 747-8 is the largest, most powerful, and more fuel-efficient model of the 747 series. The aircraft first flew in February 2010 and entered service as a freighter in August 2011, with the passenger version entering service in May 2012. The model has sold a total of 150 aircraft. </p>

					<h2>Significance</h2>
					<div id="AF1"></div>
					<p>The 747 was the first widebody passenger aircraft in the world. Whereas the 707 made air travel for the masses a possibility, the 747 made that dream a reality. For decades it was the largest passenger aircraft in the world and the workhorse of many airline fleets. In 1966, Juan Trippe, the President of Pan Am and the impetus for the 747’s conception, predicted the aircraft would be “…a great weapon for peace, competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind’s destiny.” The aircraft lived up to those words. The 747 bought cities, countries, and cultures together in ways even its creators hadn’t envisioned. It is also the world’ most recognizable plane, appearing in over 300 movies. In total, 747s have carried 3.5 billion passengers and flown 35 billion miles, or 74,000 trips to the moon and back. The plane is also entrusted to carry the most powerful man in the world. The aviation industry would be vastly different had the 747 not been created. </p>
