					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div id="A380RollOut"></div>
					<p>The A380 is the largest passenger airliner in the world by far. It carries 540 people in standard configuration, but it can carry up to 850 passengers in a high-density configuration. The airplane was introduced to compete with the unchallenged Boeing 747. The plane features two full decks stacked on top of each other, is powered by four high-powered engines typically used on a twinjet, and has one of the longest ranges in the world. Creating and operating such a large aircraft proved to be aviation’s largest challenge as well as its largest headache.</p>

					<h2>Big Problems For A Big Plane</h2>
					<div id="A3XX"></div>
					<p>The A380 concept began studies in the mid 1990s. Airbus saw a future where air travel would continue to increase exponentially and the hub-and-spoke model would be the de facto operating methods for airlines. In this method, passengers fly to a large hub from small cities, and fly to other large hubs or spoke cities. This would lead to demand for high-capacity planes such as the A380. In December 2000, the program was officially launched.</p>

					<div id="A380Prod"></div>
					<p>Building the A380 was unlike any other aircraft before it. The largest wings in the world had to be designed to not break under their own weight, the landing gear needed to be redesigned to handle the forces the million-pound aircraft would exert, new materials needed to be developed to ensure the big plane was light enough to fly, and getting all the parts and sections to the company’s plant in Toulouse needed a redesign of the supply chain. The original development cost was estimated to be $11 billion. However, due to the scope of innovative engineering needed, as well as other unforeseen circumstances, the program ended up costing Airbus $25 billion. </p>

					<h2>King of the Skies</h2>

					<h3>First Flight and Certification</h3>
					<div id="A380FF"></div>
					<p>The aircraft was rolled out to the world on January 18, 2005 with the first flight following a few months later on April 27, 2005. However, the production and testing phase almost immediately hit snags. The first set of delays were attributed to the complexity introduced by 330 miles of wiring in each aircraft and variations due to customizations from each airline. A second, even larger problem was discovered when some parts did not interface as expected. The German and Spanish arms of Airbus used different versions of the CATIA software from the French and British arms of the company. Fixing this avoidable error pushed the program into three more delays, bring the total delays to just over two years.</p>

					<div id="SIAA380"></div>
					<p>Eventually all the production issues were sorted out and the A380 received certification on December 12, 2006. The first aircraft was delivered to launch customer Singapore Airlines on October 15, 2007. The inaugural passenger flight was scheduled for October 25, 2007 between Singapore and Sydney. This inaugural was unlike any other inaugural for an airliner. Instead of passengers booking tickets like they normally would, the seats for the inaugural were sold off in an auction to the highest bidders, with the proceeds going to charity. One passenger bid and paid as much as $100, 380 for a first-class seat on the inaugural flight. The company’s CEO reported that the A380 burned 20% less fuel than the 747-400 it was replacing and that customer satisfaction had increased thanks to the A380. </p>

					<div id="EKA380"></div>
					<p>Emirates was the second airline to take delivery of the A380. The airline has over 120 orders for the aircraft, 90 of which have already been delivered. The airline is the largest operator of the type and a great majority of the airline’s flights are operated by an A380. The A380 has been perfect for Emirates since it is an aircraft optimized for megahub operations like the one the airline runs out of its base in Dubai. The size of the airliner has allowed Emirates to offer amenities such as apartment style suites, a bar lounge, and even showers to their premium customers on the airplane which helps set it in a different league from its competitors. CEO Tim Clark has repeatedly praised the aircraft for its performance given Dubai’s hot and dry climate, for its fuel efficiency over a variety of ranges, and the level of service that can be offered to the passenger. The airline recently placed more orders for A380s. </p>

					<h2>Further Developments</h2>
					<h3>A380 Plus</h3>
					<div id="A380Plus"></div>
					<p>The A380Plus was announced in June 2017 as an upgrade to the A380 program. The hub-and-spoke future Airbus had envisioned hadn’t quite materialized and demand was for the plane was drastically lower than forecasted. The Plus introduced modifications to the cabin layout to allow for 80 more seats, driving down the cost per available seat mile. The most notable difference is the addition of new split winglets, reducing fuel burn by 4%. One of the biggest complaints of customers was that the aircraft needed to be consistently filled to offset the high operating cost, not an easy task. With the new update Airbus hopes to reduce operating cost and have more seats available to help offset the fixed operating costs further. The update also changed the maintenance schedule, meaning the aircraft can go longer between checkups thanks to new materials and processes to increase revenue potential.</p>

					<p>There was an A380-900 and A380 freighter also planned when the model launched. However, due to the costly delays getting the A380 into service and the 2008 recession, the demand for the other two planned variants evaporated and the planned models were cancelled. If the global economy continues stimulate demand for air travel, and if oil prices can remain stable, Airbus has stated they will consider bringing new models into production. In the present day the demand is not there yet. </p>

				<!-- Significance -->
				<div class="infoCard">
					<h2>Significance</h2>
					<div id="WhyA380"></div>
					<p>The A380 is the pinnacle of the Jet Age and what airplanes are capable of. What began as being able to travel to other countries within hours instead of days or weeks evolved and culminated into enjoying a couple of martinis before a pre-landing shower onboard the largest airliner in the world. Just as the jetset had envisioned. One single A380 can fly twice as far as the 707 while carrying 5 times the passengers with more comfort and luxuries available to them. Though the plane may not have sold as well as Airbus had hoped, there’s no denying the A380 is the epitome of aviation. It is a plane of superlatives. </p>
