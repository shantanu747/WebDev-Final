					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div id="T7Intro"></div>
					<p>The Boeing 777 is the world’s largest and longest-range twin-engine aircraft. It has replaced the Boeing 747 jumbo on most routes today and has made possible the opening of many routes that were previously impossible. The plane was designed at the turn of the millennium as the future of long-haul air travel. In the early 1990s, fuel costs were rising and airlines were demanding a long-range aircraft with two engines, instead of the usual four or three engines. New advancements in engine technology as well as relaxing of rules made the 777 feasible. </p>

					<p>The 777 is one of Boeing’s best-selling models, selling more than the Boeing 747 and the Boeing 727. Just like the 747 was the backbone of long-haul fleets around the world in the 20th century, the 777 has taken over long-haul air travel with 7 of the 10 longest routes in the world being flown by it today. The success of the 777 has helped develop a market for other long-haul twinjets such as the Airbus A330, Airbus A350, and the Boeing 787. </p>

				<!-- Design and Dev -->

					<h2>Design and Development</h2>
					<div id="Design777"></div>
					<p>Twinjets were long shut out of most long-haul routes not just because of lack of performance, but also due to government regulations. Extended Twin Engine Operations (ETOPS) prevented twinjets from flying more than 60 minutes from the nearest viable airport. Trijets and Quadjets were exempt from this rule. However, thanks to advancements in engine reliability and safety, these rules were being relaxed, making twinjets viable for long ocean crossings. A new capable twinjet now needed to be developed to take advantage of the new rules. </p>

					<p>The original 777 was supposed to satisfy the segment where a 767 was too small but a 747 was too big of an aircraft. The aircraft needed to carry around 300 passengers with roughly 12 hours of range. The 777 program had many firsts in Boeing history. It was the first airliner designed entirely with computers, it was the first Boeing airliner to be designed with fly-by-wire, it would be the first twinjet to have ETOPS certification at delivery, the first Boeing aircraft with unprecedented global subcontracting involved, and it was the first airliner designed in close collaboration with eight other airlines. Boeing normally conducted their own market research and designed their aircraft, in this case Boeing closely consulted with their most important customers to gain insight into their expectations of the new plane.</p>

					<div id="BigEngine"></div>
					<p>Using only two engines to power such a large airplane required much more powerful engines than were available at the time. Pratt and Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls-Royce all had to design brand new engines that were significantly larger, more powerful than anything built before, and more fuel efficient than before. They settled on a high-bypass turbofan engine with the highest bypass ratio of any engines at the time. The engines would be so massive, the entire fuselage of a Boeing 707/737 could fit inside it.</p>

					<p>The landing gear and wings also had to be innovated on to allow for the added weight of such an aircraft. The 777 features a landing gear with 6 wheels on each gear instead of the usual 4. The wheels on the landing gear are also the largest diameter wheels on any jet airliner. The wing of the new plane was a supercritical airfoil with increased thickness and longer span than traditional wings. This helped increase cruising speed, improve takeoff performance, and allow the plane to cruise at higher altitudes where it is more efficient. </p>

					<h2>Twin Takeover</h2>
					<h3>Testing and Certification</h3>
					<div id="T7FirstFlight"></div>
					<p>The 777 flew for the first time on June 12, 1994. The testing program lasted 11 months during which the aircraft’s performance and reliability were stress tested many times over. To allow for ETOPS certification, eight flights where the airplane operated on a single engine were performed. This demonstrated that the aircraft could safely fly for 3 full hours with one engine inoperable. On April 19, 1995 the aircraft was certified by the FAA and JAA.</p>

					<h3>Entry Into Service</h3>
					<div id="T7EIS"></div>
					<p>The first 777 was delivered to launch customer United Airlines on May 15, 1995. The first commercial flight was between Washington Dulles and London Heathrow on June 7, 1995. It became the first airliner to have ETOPS clearance on its inaugural flight. Initial operations with the GE-90 proved troublesome, requiring airlines to temporarily withdraw the plane from service while a fix was applied. The engines were bigger and more powerful than anything built before, leading to several minor teething issues. This did not affect the entry into service too much and the 777 was able to maintain a dispatch reliability rate above 99%.</p>

					<h2>Further Developments</h2>
					<h3>777-200ER</h3>
					<div id="B77E"></div>
					<p>The original 777, the 777-200 was more of a proof of concept for the twinjet. Boeing engineers had designed the 777 more far more capabilities than the original model allowed. On February 9, 1997 the first 777-200ER entered service. The “ER” stood for “extended range”. The aircraft was based on the 777-200 body but featured more powerful engines and more fuel tanks as well as a strengthened landing gear and wing. This increased the 777’s range by over 2,000 miles, allowing the plane to cross the Pacific and Atlantic oceans comfortably. For a while this was the most popular 777 model with 422 delivered. </p>
					
					<h3>777-300</h3>
					<div id="B773"></div>
					<p>The 777-200 received a 33-foot fuselage stretch allowing for up to 75 more seats. The aircraft would have similar MTOW as the 777-200, meaning it did not have the long range of a 200ER but could carry many more passengers. The 777-300 was designed as a short to medium haul people mover, ideal for busy domestic and regional routes. The variant entered service in 1998 and a total of 60 delivered. </p>

					<h3>777-300ER/200LR</h3>
					<div id="B77W"></div>
					<p>With the 777 proving to be successful at performing much more economically on routes previously operated by the 747, Boeing kept pushing the abilities of the aircraft. The 777-300ER was based on the 777-300. It featured new GE90 engines that produced 115,000 lbs of thrust each, these are the most powerful aircraft engines in the world to this day. This allowed the aircraft to carry more passengers, payload, and fuel for longer flights. The wings were also tweaked to have a raked wingtip which increased wingspan and made the plane more fuel efficient. The plane entered service with Air France in 2004. Long polar routes such as Dubai – Los Angeles and San Francisco to Dubai, previously not possible, were suddenly made possible by this aircraft. Airlines around the world have chosen the 777-300ER to replace the heavier and less fuel-efficient 747s in their long-haul fleets. It is the most successful variant of the 777 with 767 delivered and 72 yet to be delivered. </p>

					<div id="B77L"></div>
					<p>The 777-200LR was designed in conjunction with the 777-300ER. It also featured the bigger and more powerful GE90 engines and improved wings, but it was based on the shorter 777-200 fuselage. This meant the 777-200LR (longer range) carried less passengers and cargo. However, since it could carry the same weight and fuel, the plane became the longest-range passenger airliner in the world. It has made direct flights in excess of 17 hours possible. The plane entered service in February 2006 and a total of 59 have been delivered. </p>

					<h3>777X</h3>
					<div id="B778"></div>
					<p>The 777-8 is slated to enter service in 2022 and replace the 777-200LR. The variant currently has 53 orders. It will be the shorter of the two 777X variants but carry the same amount of fuel and have the same amount of power. The lower weight and smaller payload will allow the airplane to fly 10,000 miles nonstop making it the longest-range airliner in the world when it enters service. To increase wingspan but still have the airplane fit into existing gates, the 777-8 and 777-9 will feature folding wingtips, which will fold in when on the ground to meet clearance requirements, and extend at takeoff and during flight to improve takeoff and cruise performance. </p>

					<div id="B779"></div>
					<p>The 777-9 is the longer of the two 777X variants and is slated to replace the 777-300ER. It will be the longest airliner in the world when it enters service, being bigger than the current longest airliner, the 747-8. It will feature the same wing, fuel capacity, and engines as the 777-8. While by no means lacking in the range department, it trades range for more passenger and cargo capacity vs the 777-8. The plane is expected to enter service in 2020 and currently has 273 orders.</p>

				<!-- Significance -->
				<div class="infoCard">
					<h2>Significance</h2>
					<div id="Why777"></div>
					<p>Twin-engine aircraft were limited to domestic and overland routes for much of the jet age. However, with rising fuel costs, improving technology, and changing regulations, twinjets could, for the first time, become high-capacity long-haul airliners. Routes previously flown exclusively by the 747 or large three engine aircraft, are all now flown by twinjets, many of them by the 777. The 777 has reduced operating and maintenance costs for airlines, resulting in cheaper airfares for passengers. The 777 also introduced and normalized a new form of air-travel, ultra-long-haul flights. Nonstop flights from the Middle-East to North and South America are now routine thanks to the 777. From the list above, one can see just how ubiquitous this airplane has become with long-range flights which were previously either not possible, or possible but not economically viable. The future of the aviation industry is twinjets and the advancements of the Boeing 777 helped push the industry in that direction. </p>
